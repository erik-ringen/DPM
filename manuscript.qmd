## Introduction

Co-evolution can be identified statistically as non-zero between-trait phylogenetic correlations----or any other measure of mutual information over evolutionary time. Trait co-evolution is of interest in ecology and evolution when phylogenetic correlations are thought to reflect directed, causal relationships between traits, or when correlated traits share common causes.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
